            <h2>Basic example #3: Analysis of a pressure vessel.</h2>
            <p>The following figure represents the cross-section of an axisymmetric pressure vessel:</p>
            <img src="resources/basic3_1.png">
            <p>The cylindrical pressure vessel has two hemispherical ends, one of which is supported by a skirt. Dimensions are shown in mm. The material (steel) is considered elastic, homogeneous, and isotropic, defined by a Young's modulus of 210 GPa, a Poisson's ration of 0.3, and a density of 7.85 g/cm³. The internal pressure has a magnitude of 80 Bar(g). The objective is to perform a static analysis in order to determine if the pressure vessel can handle the internal pressure. The self-weight of the vessel should be considered in the analysis. An axisymmetric stress state is assumed.</p>
            <p>Consistent units: below, the geometry will be defined in mm, whereas the Young's modulus and internal pressure are defined in MPa. Additionally, the acceleration due to gravity is specified in mm/s² and the density is specified in t/mm³. Consequently, results are computed in N (forces), mm (displacements), mm/mm (strains), and MPa (stresses).</p>
            <p>The FEAPACK files for this example can be found <a href="https://github.com/carlos-souto/FEAPACK/tree/master/docs/examples/basic3">here</a>.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <h2>Solution via FEAPACK:</h2>
            <p>Start by creating a job script named <code>basic3.py</code> and import the modules shown below. In this example, we will run the solver in parallel mode. For multiprocessing, the main guard is required:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums:1"><code class="language-py">import feapack.model
import feapack.solver

# main guard required for multiprocessing
if __name__ == '__main__':
            </code></pre>
            <p>For this example, a finite element mesh has been prepared in <code>basic3.inp</code>:</p>
            <img src="resources/basic3_2.png">
            <p>The <code>basic3.inp</code> defines 51,007 nodes and 24,320 <code>CAX6</code> elements. The supported Abaqus element types are automatically converted into the comparable FEAPACK element types (in this case, the <code>CAX6</code> elements are converted into <code>Plane6</code> elements). Additionally, Abaqus stores the element connectivity using 1-based indexing, which is automatically converted into 0-based indexing, as required by FEAPACK.</p>
            <p>The mesh input file also defines the following sets:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>'INTERNAL-SURFACE-NODES'</code> containing the nodes coinciding with the internal surface of the pressure vessel.</li>
                <li><code>'BASE-NODES'</code> containing the nodes coinciding with the bottom surface of the skirt, contacting the ground.</li>
                <li><code>'ALL-ELEMENTS'</code>containing all the elements of the finite element mesh.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Due to a technical limitation, the name of any set defined within an Abaqus input file is always automatically converted to upper case. Moreover, 1-based indexing is automatically converted into 0-based indexing, as required by FEAPACK.</p>
            <p>Inside the main guard of the job script, the following code loads the mesh shown above into a new model database (MDB) and prints the names of the available node and element sets:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums:7"><code class="language-py"></code>    # create model database (MDB)
    mdb = feapack.model.MDB.fromFile('basic3.inp')

    # node sets and element sets are defined in the 'basic3.inp' file
    # set names are automatically converted to upper case (technical limitation)
    print('Node sets:', *mdb.nodeSets.keys())       # Node sets: INTERNAL-SURFACE-NODES BASE-NODES
    print('Element sets:', *mdb.elementSets.keys()) # Element sets: ALL-ELEMENTS
            </pre>
            <p>Next, the surface set shown below is created. Surface sets cannot be defined in a mesh input file, as they are based on a custom implementation:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums:15"><code class="language-py">    # however, surface sets in FEAPACK have their own format, so they have to be created here
    mdb.surfaceSet(name='INTERNAL-SURFACE', surfaceNodes='INTERNAL-SURFACE-NODES')
            </code></pre>
            <p>The material and section are defined as follows:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums:18"><code class="language-py">    # create material and section
    mdb.material(name='STEEL', young=210000.0, poisson=0.3, density=7.85e-9) # density required for gravity load
    mdb.section(
        name='STEEL-SECTION',
        region='ALL-ELEMENTS',
        material='STEEL',
        type=feapack.model.SectionTypes.Axisymmetric, # or simply 'Axisymmetric'
        reducedIntegration=False
    )
            </code></pre>
            <p>We then define the following loads and boundary condition:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums:28"><code class="language-py">    # create loads
    mdb.acceleration(name='GRAVITY', region='ALL-ELEMENTS', y=-9806.65)
    mdb.pressure(name='INTERNAL-PRESSURE', region='INTERNAL-SURFACE', magnitude=8.0)

    # create boundary condition
    mdb.boundaryCondition(name='FIXED-BASE', region='BASE-NODES', u=0.0, v=0.0)
            </code></pre>
            <p>Finally, we call the solver, still within the main guard:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums:35"><code class="language-py">    # call solver inside main guard for multiprocessing
    # specifying processes > 1 will enable parallel mode
    feapack.solver.solve(mdb, analysis='static', processes=4)
            </code></pre>
            <p>To actually perform the finite element analysis, the following command is used: <code>python basic3.py</code>. The file <code>basic3.out</code> will be generated upon a successful run. Then, the viewer application can be launched using the following command: <code>python -m feapack.viewer</code>.</p>
            <p>Animated results generated using the viewer application:</p>

            <p>As a form of validation, here are the results from FEAPACK vs. Abaqus using the comparable <code>CAX6</code> element:</p>
